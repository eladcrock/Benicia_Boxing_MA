        attacks. We also train in traditional Chinese and Japanese weapons.

        <strong> Kenpo Karate </strong>
        incorporates all the strikes you will find in long-range fighting, such
        as Tae Kwon Do. Our Mid-Range fighting techniques will teach you how to
        use your hands for blindingly fast striking. For close-in fighting
        you’ll learn how to deliver crushing elbows and knees. Martial arts is a
        great way to hone your character while keeping your body, mind and
        spirit sharp. Gichin Funakoshi, the father of Karate, once said,
        “control your body, control your mind, control your life, control your
        destiny.”{" "}
